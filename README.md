# Data-Analysis-Dashboard
I developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard analyzing the India General Election Results â€“ 2024 using a CSV file. The dashboard visualizes seat distributions and performance metrics for the NDA, I.N.D.I.A., and independent parties, featuring interactive elements like slicers, KPI tiles, and alliance logos for clear, data-driven insights.
